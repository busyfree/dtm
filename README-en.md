## dtm vs other

At present, the open source distributed transaction framework has not yet seen a mature framework for non-Java languages. There are many Java projects, such as Ali's SEATA, Huawei's ServiceComb-Pack, JD's shardingsphere, and himly, tcc-transaction, ByteTCC, etc. Among them, seata is the most widely used.

The following is a comparison of the main features of dtm and seata:

| Features | DTM | SEATA | Remarks |
|:-----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| Supported languages| <span style="color:green">Golang, python, php, c# and others</span> | <span style="color:orange">Java</span> |dtm can easily support a new language|
|Exception Handling| <span style="color:green">[Sub-transaction barrier automatic processing](./doc/barrier-en.md)</span>|<span style="color:orange">Manual processing</span> | dtm solves idempotence, suspension, and null compensation|

From the features of the comparison above, if your language stack includes languages ​​other than Java, then dtm is your first choice. If your language stack is Java, you can also choose to access dtm and use sub-transaction barrier technology to simplify your business writing.

# Quick start
### Installation
`git clone https://github.com/yedf/dtm`
### DTM depends on mysql

Configure mysql:

`cp conf.sample.yml conf.yml # Modify conf.yml`

### Start and run the saga example
`go run app/main.go`

# Start using

### Use
``` go
  // business microservice address
  const qsBusi = "http://localhost:8081/api/busi_saga"
  req := &gin.H{"amount": 30} // Microservice payload
  // The address where DtmServer serves DTM, which is a url
  DtmServer := "http://localhost:8080/api/dtmsvr"
  saga := dtmcli.NewSaga(DtmServer, dtmcli.MustGenGid(DtmServer)).
    // Add a TransOut sub-transaction, the operation is url: qsBusi+"/TransOut"，
    // compensation operation is url: qsBusi+"/TransOutCompensate"
    Add(qsBusi+"/TransOut", qsBusi+"/TransOutCompensate", req).
    // Add a TransIn sub-transaction, the operation is url: qsBusi+"/TransOut"，
    // compensation operation is url: qsBusi+"/TransInCompensate"
    Add(qsBusi+"/TransIn", qsBusi+"/TransInCompensate", req)
  // Submit the saga transaction, dtm will complete all sub-transactions/rollback all sub-transactions
  err := saga.Submit()
```
